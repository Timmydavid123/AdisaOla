    description: "In Yoruba culture, Onídìrí means the, hair stylist a custodian of beauty and heritage. Hair is not just beauty; it is a crown, carrying stories of lineage, pride, and resilience. To sit before an Onidiri is to learn patience, to embrace heritage, and to be adorned with dignity. Every female child can resonate with this image, for the ritual of hair-making is universal hours of care, the touch of nurturing hands, and the quiet lessons passed from one generation to the next.

    title: "Shades of Innocence",
    artist: "Adisa Olahile",
    description: "I captured  this amazing image during the joy of Eid, Shades of Innocence reflects the quiet strength and playful spirit of childhood. The young girl, framed in her crisp attire and bold pink glasses, embodies the balance between tradition and individuality. Her gaze serious yet tender invites us to see beyond celebration into the heart of resilience, identity, and self-expression. This image speaks to anyone who remembers the wonder of being a child navigating culture, faith, and the small rebellions that make us who we are. It is both intimate and universal, a reminder that innocence wears many shades.",
